This project implements a synchronous FIFO (First-In-First-Out) memory buffer in SystemVerilog. The FIFO supports parameterizable data width and depth, with full and empty flags to indicate its status.

A complete testbench environment is included, featuring:
Interface-based signal connection.
Transaction class for randomized read/write operations.
Generator and driver classes to drive stimulus to the FIFO.
Waveform generation (.vcd) for simulation analysis.
The design ensures proper synchronous read/write operations, prevents overflow and underflow, and demonstrates reliable FIFO behavior under random conditions.

Key Features:

Parameterizable data width and FIFO depth.
Synchronous read and write operations.
full and empty status flags.
Randomized transaction verification.
Waveform generation for debugging.

Simulation:

The project can be simulated using ModelSim, QuestaSim, or any SystemVerilog-compatible simulator.
